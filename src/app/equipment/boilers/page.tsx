const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "How often should a commercial boiler be serviced?",
    a: "Commercial boilers should receive a comprehensive preventative maintenance inspection at minimum once per year, typically timed before the heating season. Higher-utilization facilities — hospitals, laundries, food processing operations, and year-round process steam users — typically schedule quarterly visits. The correct interval depends on boiler age, operating pressure, fuel type, water quality, and how critical continuous operation is to the facility. A maintenance program scoped to the equipment and the facility's risk tolerance is more useful than a calendar default.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between LPS and HPS boilers?",
    a: "Low-pressure steam (LPS) boilers operate at 15 psi or below and supply space heating, domestic hot water, and building humidification loads. High-pressure steam (HPS) boilers operate above 15 psi and serve process loads — sterilization, laundry, food processing, and industrial applications. HPS boilers fall under California's mandatory boiler inspection program and require licensed operator involvement at many facilities. Both types share common maintenance requirements around combustion tuning, water treatment, and safety device testing, but the regulatory framework and service procedures differ significantly between pressure classes.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does combustion analysis involve?",
    a: "Combustion analysis measures the concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide in the boiler's flue gases using a calibrated combustion analyzer. From those measurements, a technician calculates combustion efficiency, excess air percentage, and CO output. The burner's air-to-fuel ratio is then adjusted to achieve the target combustion profile for that boiler at its operating condition. Gardner Air performs combustion analysis on every boiler maintenance visit — not as an add-on but as a core scope item.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are California's boiler inspection requirements?",
    a: "California requires periodic inspection of boilers by a state-certified boiler inspector or a carrier inspector working under the California Department of Industrial Relations. Inspection frequency and requirements depend on boiler classification and operating pressure. In Southern California, facilities also need to account for SCAQMD Rule 1146.2 and related emissions regulations governing NOx output from commercial boilers. Gardner Air's service documentation is structured to support state inspection preparation and to flag equipment conditions that would not pass inspection.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are signs my boiler needs immediate service?",
    a: "Indicators requiring prompt attention include: unexpected safety shutdowns or lockouts, flame failure alarms, low-water cutoff activation, unusual stack color or odor, loss of steam pressure or hot water temperature, CO detector alarms near the mechanical room, and visible water accumulation around the boiler. Any of these conditions left unaddressed can escalate from a serviceable fault to a pressure vessel failure. Facilities with Gardner Air maintenance agreements receive priority scheduling when these conditions are reported.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you service my brand of boiler?",
    a: "Gardner Air holds factory training on major commercial boiler platforms, including Cleaver-Brooks, Weil-McLain, Burnham, Lochinvar, Fulton, Aerco, Miura, Bryan Steam, and Superior Boiler. For manufacturers not listed, call (951) 696-4495 with the make, model, and pressure class. Gardner Air services a wide range of commercial pressure vessel equipment and will give a direct answer on whether the specific unit falls within their program.",

const BOILER_TYPES = [
  {
    title: "Hot Water Boilers (Condensing)",
    body: "Condensing hot water boilers extract heat from flue gases by dropping stack temperatures below the dew point of combustion products, recovering latent heat and achieving thermal efficiencies above 90%. They are common in newer commercial construction and retrofit applications where natural gas costs justify the capital investment. Gardner Air's service scope for condensing units includes heat exchanger inspection, condensate management, flue gas analysis, and controls calibration to ensure the unit consistently operates in condensing mode.",
  },
  {
    title: "Hot Water Boilers (Non-Condensing)",
    body: "Non-condensing hot water boilers operate at higher stack temperatures and are the standard in older commercial and institutional facilities. They remain reliable workhorses when maintained correctly. Service requirements include combustion analysis to verify burner efficiency, heat exchanger inspection for scale and corrosion, and controls verification to confirm safety limits and operating setpoints are accurate.",
  },
  {
    title: "Low-Pressure Steam Boilers (LPS)",
    body: "Low-pressure steam boilers operate below 15 psi and supply space heating, humidification, and process loads across institutional and commercial buildings. Gardner Air services the full system: burner and combustion train, steam trap condition, condensate return piping integrity, low-water cutoff testing, and chemical treatment verification.",
  },
  {
    title: "High-Pressure Steam Boilers (HPS)",
    body: "High-pressure steam boilers operating above 15 psi are found in hospitals, laundries, industrial facilities, and food processing plants where process steam loads require elevated pressure and temperature. These systems fall under California's mandatory boiler inspection program. Gardner Air's technicians work within that regulatory framework, coordinating service documentation to support state inspection requirements and maintaining the safety systems — flame safeguard, pressure relief, low-water cutoff — that regulators and insurance carriers require to be fully functional.",
  },
  {
    title: "Firetube vs. Watertube Boilers",
    body: "Firetube boilers route combustion gases through tubes surrounded by water and are the most common design in commercial applications up to roughly 25,000 lb/hr of steam. Watertube boilers circulate water through tubes surrounded by combustion gases and are used in high-capacity and high-pressure applications. Each design has distinct tube inspection protocols, cleaning requirements, and failure modes. Gardner Air services both configurations and documents tube condition on every visit.",
  },

Every visit covers the complete maintenance scope: combustion analysis and burner tuning, heat exchanger inspection, water chemistry testing, safety control testing (low-water cutoff, pressure relief, flame safeguard), scale and sediment assessment, feedwater system inspection, and a full written service report. No items deferred because the scheduled time ran out.",
  },
  {
    title: "Repair and Troubleshooting",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/repair/",
    body: "When a boiler is performing outside specification or has gone offline, Gardner Air diagnoses the root cause before replacing components. Repair and troubleshooting covers combustion train evaluation, tube leak identification and assessment, controls fault analysis, flame safeguard system testing, feedwater pump evaluation, and safety device verification. Existing maintenance clients receive priority scheduling.",
  },
  {
    title: "Replacement",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/replacement/",
    body: "When a boiler reaches end of service life or a major failure makes replacement the correct financial decision, Gardner Air manages the replacement process from equipment specification through commissioning — including coordination with California boiler inspection authorities, new-unit startup, combustion commissioning, and controls integration.",
  },
  {
    title: "Installation and Startup",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/installation/",
    body: "New boiler installation and startup is a multi-discipline process. Combustion commissioning, pressure testing, safety device calibration, water chemistry baseline establishment, and controls integration all occur before Gardner Air considers a system accepted. Factory startup procedures are followed for each manufacturer's equipment.",
  },
];

const COMMON_ISSUES = [
  {
    title: "Combustion tuning drift",
    body: "Burner air-to-fuel ratios shift over time as components wear and fuel supply conditions change. A boiler operating with incorrect combustion produces excess CO, wastes fuel, or both. Gardner Air performs flue gas analysis on every preventative maintenance visit to verify and correct combustion performance.",
  },
  {
    title: "Scale and sediment buildup",
    body: "Mineral deposits on heat transfer surfaces insulate the tubes and force the boiler to work harder to deliver the same output, raising fuel consumption and accelerating tube degradation. Water chemistry monitoring and treatment verification are standard components of every Gardner Air boiler visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Tube fouling and leaks",
    body: "Heat exchanger tubes develop fouling from both the water side and the combustion side. Tube leaks introduce water into the combustion chamber or flue and can progress rapidly to a major failure if not caught early. Gardner Air inspects tubes at every scheduled visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Low-water cutoff failures",
    body: "The low-water cutoff is the primary safety device preventing a fired boiler from operating without adequate water — a condition that leads to catastrophic heat exchanger failure. Gardner Air tests low-water cutoff operation on every maintenance visit and replaces any device that does not perform within specification.",
  },
  {
    title: "Feedwater pump issues",
    body: "A feedwater pump that loses capacity or fails intermittently allows boiler water level to fluctuate, triggering safety shutdowns and stressing the heat exchanger. Gardner Air evaluates pump condition, seal integrity, and motor performance as part of the standard boiler maintenance scope.",
  },
  {
    title: "Flame safeguard and controls failures",
    body: "Flame safeguard systems govern ignition sequencing, flame supervision, and safety shutdown. Component drift in UV scanners, ignition electrodes, or the control module itself can cause nuisance lockouts or, more seriously, unsafe operating conditions. Gardner Air tests and verifies the complete flame safeguard sequence on every visit.",

                  <p>
                    Commercial boilers are pressure vessels operating under continuous thermal and mechanical stress. A hospital boiler supplying steam to sterilization equipment or a university campus boiler heating a network of buildings is not a system that tolerates deferred maintenance or generalist technicians.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gardner Air specializes in commercial and industrial boiler systems serving hospitals, universities, hotels, large office buildings, laundries, and food processing facilities throughout Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Orange County. When a boiler loses pressure, fails a combustion test, or goes offline mid-winter, the consequences reach every occupied zone connected to the distribution system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Commercial boiler service demands specific competencies: combustion analysis, water chemistry management, tube inspection, flame safeguard system verification, and familiarity with California boiler inspection requirements and SCAQMD emissions standards applicable to Southern California facilities. Gardner Air&rsquo;s technicians bring that competency to every visit — not a subset of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Facilities managers across Southern California retain Gardner Air not for emergencies, but to prevent them.
