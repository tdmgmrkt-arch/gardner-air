const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "How often should computer room units be serviced?",
    a: "Computer room units serving data centers, server rooms, and other mission-critical facilities should receive comprehensive preventative maintenance at minimum four times per year — quarterly — given their continuous operation and the consequences of unplanned failure. High-criticality applications with N+1 redundancy or higher may schedule maintenance visits more frequently to allow planned unit rotation through the maintenance program without reducing the facility below its redundancy threshold. A maintenance program scoped to your facility's redundancy architecture and equipment count is the correct starting point.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a CRAC and a CRAH unit?",
    a: "A CRAC unit (Computer Room Air Conditioner) contains a self-contained direct-expansion refrigerant circuit — compressor, condenser, and evaporator — and does not require a chilled water plant. A CRAH unit (Computer Room Air Handler) circulates chilled water from a central chiller plant through a coil inside the unit and does not contain a refrigerant circuit. CRAC units are more common in smaller facilities and where chilled water infrastructure does not exist. CRAH units are more common in large data centers where a central chiller plant is already in service. Each requires distinct maintenance scope: refrigerant circuit management for CRAC, chilled water system management for CRAH.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do computer room units typically last?",
    a: "Computer room units maintained on a disciplined preventative maintenance program typically last 10 to 15 years. The compressor (CRAC) and the humidification system are the primary cost drivers in aging equipment. Humidifier cylinder or electrode replacement is a recurring maintenance item rather than a failure event — but only if the humidification system is inspected regularly. CRAH coil longevity depends heavily on chilled water chemistry; a facility with poor water treatment will see coil fouling and deterioration significantly accelerate unit aging.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are warning signs a computer room unit needs immediate attention?",
    a: "Indicators that a computer room unit requires prompt attention include: room temperature rising above setpoint with the unit running, humidity drifting outside the 40–60% RH band, a CRAC unit reporting low refrigerant pressure, unusual noise from the unit's fan or compressor, visible water below the unit drain pan, and environmental monitoring system alarms on temperature or humidity at the rack level. Any of these conditions in a data center environment can escalate from a manageable maintenance issue to a server thermal event within hours. Facilities with Gardner Air maintenance agreements receive priority scheduling when these conditions are reported.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Gardner Air handle urgent computer room unit issues for maintenance clients?",
    a: "Gardner Air is a preventative maintenance firm, not a 24/7 emergency dispatch service. That distinction is intentional: the mission-critical facilities Gardner Air serves experience far fewer unplanned computer room unit failures because maintenance is completed to full scope on every visit and developing problems are identified before they become failures. When an existing maintenance client reports an urgent condition affecting precision cooling, Gardner Air prioritizes their scheduling. Facilities seeking a proactive maintenance partnership that reduces downtime risk are the right fit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Gardner Air service my brand of computer room unit?",
    a: "Gardner Air holds factory training on the major precision cooling platforms, including Liebert (Vertiv), Stulz, Data Aire, Schneider Electric (APC), and Airedale. For manufacturers not listed, call (951) 696-4495 with the make and model. Gardner Air services a wide range of commercial precision cooling equipment and will give a direct answer on whether the specific unit falls within their program.",

const CRAC_TYPES = [
  {
    title: "CRAC Units (Computer Room Air Conditioners)",
    body: "Computer Room Air Conditioners use a direct-expansion refrigerant circuit — compressor, condenser, and evaporator — to cool and dehumidify air circulated through the server room. They are the most widely deployed precision cooling technology in small-to-mid-size data centers, server rooms, and network operations centers. CRAC units are available in downflow, upflow, and ceiling-mounted configurations and require refrigerant circuit maintenance, humidity control calibration, and EC fan verification that differs from standard commercial DX equipment.",
  },
  {
    title: "CRAH Units (Computer Room Air Handlers)",
    body: "Computer Room Air Handlers use chilled water supplied by a central chiller plant rather than a self-contained refrigerant circuit. They are common in large data centers and enterprise facilities with existing chilled water infrastructure. CRAH units offer high efficiency at scale but introduce the maintenance requirements of the chilled water loop — coil fouling, water chemistry, valve operation, and flow rate verification — in addition to the air-side maintenance of the unit itself.",
  },
  {
    title: "In-Row Cooling",
    body: "In-row cooling units are installed directly within server aisles, capturing hot exhaust air from rack equipment at the source rather than conditioning the entire room. They are deployed in high-density data center environments where traditional room-level precision cooling cannot remove heat loads fast enough. In-row units introduce additional refrigerant circuits, condensate management requirements, and controls integration points within the active data center floor — all of which require maintenance without disrupting active server operations.",
  },
  {
    title: "Rear-Door Heat Exchangers",
    body: "Rear-door heat exchangers mount directly to the back of server racks and capture heat at the point of generation using chilled water coils. They are used in the highest-density compute environments where overhead cooling approaches cannot keep pace with rack-level heat loads. Gardner Air services rear-door heat exchangers as part of a complete facility precision cooling program, including coil condition, supply water temperature verification, flow rate, and connection integrity.",
  },
  {
    title: "Redundancy and N+1 Planning",
    body: "Computer room cooling systems in mission-critical facilities are typically configured with N+1 or higher redundancy — at least one additional unit beyond what is required to handle the full facility load. Gardner Air evaluates existing redundancy configurations during assessments and provides documented recommendations when redundancy gaps are identified. Maintenance planning accounts for the redundancy architecture so units can be serviced without reducing the facility to a single-point-of-failure condition.",

  },
  {
    title: "Replacement",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/replacement/",
    body: "When a computer room unit reaches the end of its service life, Gardner Air manages the replacement process with the access constraints and uptime requirements of the active facility in mind — including refrigerant recovery (CRAC), chilled water isolation (CRAH), equipment removal without disrupting adjacent active units, new unit installation, commissioning, and startup documentation.",
  },
  {
    title: "Installation and Startup",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/installation/",
    body: "New computer room unit installation requires precise airflow orientation to the room's hot aisle and cold aisle architecture, refrigerant or chilled water connection, humidity control commissioning, sensor placement and calibration, and controls integration with the facility's environmental monitoring system.",
  },
];

const COMMON_ISSUES = [
  {
    title: "Humidity control drift",
    body: "Computer room units maintain humidity within a precise band — typically 40–60% relative humidity per ASHRAE guidelines. Humidifier element scaling, dehumidification control calibration errors, and sensor drift all allow humidity to leave the target band without triggering an obvious alarm. Gardner Air verifies humidity sensor accuracy and control system calibration on every maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Condenser water loop issues (CRAH)",
    body: "CRAH units depend on supply chilled water at the correct temperature and flow rate. Chilled water temperature outside of design range, reduced flow from a partially closed isolation valve, or coil fouling from poor water chemistry all reduce CRAH capacity without generating an immediate fault condition. Gardner Air verifies chilled water temperature, flow rate, and coil condition on every CRAH maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Refrigerant leaks (CRAC)",
    body: "A refrigerant loss event on a CRAC unit in an active server room is a time-sensitive situation — reduced cooling capacity in a high-density heat load environment degrades quickly. Gardner Air performs complete refrigerant circuit leak surveys and charge verification rather than adding refrigerant without identifying and sealing the leak source.",
  },
  {
    title: "EC fan and motor failures",
    body: "Computer room units circulate high volumes of air continuously at controlled speeds. EC fan motor failures reduce airflow and can create hotspots within the facility before overall room temperature rises enough to trigger an alarm. Gardner Air tests EC motor amperage, bearing condition, and fan speed response on every maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Sensor calibration drift",
    body: "Computer room unit controls rely on temperature and humidity sensors to manage the unit and report status to environmental monitoring systems. Sensors that drift out of calibration cause the unit to operate against incorrect data — overcooling, overhumidifying, or failing to respond to developing thermal events. Gardner Air verifies sensor accuracy against calibrated references on every maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Filter loading affecting airflow",
    body: "Computer room units with loaded filters deliver reduced airflow to the protected space. In a high-density data center, reduced airflow creates rack hotspots that can exceed server thermal limits before room-level temperature sensors respond. Gardner Air services filters on every maintenance visit — not on a deferred calendar.",

                  Mission-Critical Cooling Cannot Be Approached as an Afterthought

                  <p>
                    Computer room cooling equipment operates in a fundamentally different service context than standard commercial HVAC. The consequence of an unplanned failure is not occupant discomfort — it is thermal shutdown of servers, loss of data center uptime, disruption of telecom circuits, or equipment damage in a medical imaging suite. Facilities managers responsible for mission-critical infrastructure cannot afford to approach precision cooling as an afterthought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gardner Air specializes in the computer room units and precision cooling systems that protect data centers, colocation facilities, telecom rooms, financial operations centers, and healthcare technology environments throughout Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Orange County. CRAC and CRAH units are purpose-engineered systems with specific humidity control requirements, high sensible heat ratios, and airflow architectures designed around IT load density. Maintaining them correctly requires technicians who understand precision cooling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gardner Air completes every item on the maintenance scope during every visit and delivers a written report documenting what was found and what was done. Facilities managers retaining Gardner Air for computer room unit service are building the maintenance program that makes unplanned downtime rare, not the response plan for after it happens.

If your precision cooling equipment is on a maintenance program that does not deliver complete-scope service, humidity system verification, and written documentation after every visit, that is worth a conversation.
