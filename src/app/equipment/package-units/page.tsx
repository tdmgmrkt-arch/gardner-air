const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "How often should commercial rooftop package units be serviced?",
    a: "Commercial RTUs should receive a comprehensive preventative maintenance inspection at minimum twice per year — typically spring and fall — to prepare the unit for peak cooling and heating seasons. Facilities with high operating hours, kitchen exhaust near the intake, or high dust environments benefit from quarterly visits. The correct interval depends on unit age, application type, and how much unplanned downtime the facility can absorb. A maintenance program scoped to your specific equipment is more reliable than a generic calendar default.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a gas/electric RTU and a heat pump RTU?",
    a: "A gas/electric RTU uses a gas burner for heating and a direct-expansion refrigerant circuit for cooling — two separate systems in one enclosure. A heat pump RTU uses a reversing refrigerant circuit for both heating and cooling, eliminating the gas-fired section entirely. In Southern California's mild winters, heat pump RTUs are often cost-effective and are increasingly required under California energy codes for new commercial construction. The maintenance requirements differ: heat pump units require attention to reversing valve function, defrost controls, and refrigerant charge behavior across both operating modes.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do commercial packaged rooftop units typically last?",
    a: "Commercial RTUs maintained on a disciplined preventative maintenance program typically last 15 to 20 years. Units that receive irregular or incomplete maintenance — particularly deferred coil cleaning, ignored refrigerant loss, and skipped belt service — often require compressor or heat exchanger replacement well before that range. The compressor and heat exchanger are the primary cost drivers in aging equipment. A documented maintenance history also informs the replacement-vs.-repair decision when a major component fails late in the unit's life.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the signs a rooftop unit needs immediate attention?",
    a: "Indicators that an RTU requires prompt attention include: loss of cooling or heating capacity, refrigerant leak alarms, high discharge pressure faults, unusual compressor noise, supply air temperature deviating significantly from setpoint, and visible smoke or a gas odor from the unit. Any of these conditions left unaddressed can escalate from a serviceable repair to a compressor failure or heat exchanger crack. Facilities with Gardner Air maintenance agreements receive priority scheduling when these conditions are reported.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Gardner Air handle urgent RTU issues for maintenance clients?",
    a: "Gardner Air is a preventative maintenance firm. The facilities Gardner Air serves experience significantly fewer unplanned RTU failures because maintenance is completed to full scope on every visit, and developing problems are identified before they become failures. When an existing maintenance client reports an urgent condition, Gardner Air prioritizes their scheduling ahead of non-contract work. Facilities looking for a reactive-only dispatch service are not the right fit. Facilities looking to reduce the frequency and cost of unplanned RTU failures are.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Gardner Air service my brand of rooftop unit?",
    a: "Gardner Air holds factory training on all major commercial RTU platforms, including Carrier, Trane, Lennox, York, Rheem, Daikin, and AAON. For manufacturers not listed, call (951) 696-4495 with the make and model. Gardner Air services a wide range of commercial equipment and will give a direct answer on whether the specific unit falls within their program.",

  {
    title: "Gas/Electric RTUs",
    body: "Gas/electric packaged units combine a gas-fired heating section with a direct-expansion cooling circuit in a single rooftop enclosure. They are the most common configuration in Southern California commercial construction — used in retail centers, strip malls, office buildings, and restaurants. Gardner Air services heat exchanger condition, burner operation, ignition system, gas valve function, and the full DX refrigerant circuit on each maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Heat Pump RTUs",
    body: "Commercial heat pump RTUs provide both heating and cooling through a reversing refrigerant cycle, eliminating the gas-fired heating section. They are increasingly specified in new commercial construction where all-electric mechanical systems are required or preferred. Proper refrigerant charge, reversing valve function, defrost controls, and auxiliary heat staging all require disciplined attention to maintain rated performance across Southern California's seasonal temperature swings.",
  },
  {
    title: "High-Efficiency RTUs",
    body: "High-efficiency packaged units — typically rated at 16 EER or above — use advanced compressor staging, variable-speed supply fans, and premium heat exchanger surfaces to deliver significantly lower energy consumption than standard-efficiency equipment. The efficiency gains only materialize when the unit is maintained to tight tolerances: refrigerant charge within 2% of specification, clean coils, and calibrated economizer controls are not optional on high-efficiency equipment.",
  },
  {
    title: "Multi-Stage and VAV RTUs",
    body: "Multi-stage and variable air volume packaged units modulate compressor capacity and airflow to match actual building load rather than cycling between full-on and full-off. This reduces energy consumption and improves occupant comfort but adds mechanical and controls complexity. Gardner Air's technicians are trained on the staging logic, VFD operation, and zone controller integration that these systems require to operate correctly.",
  },
  {
    title: "RTU Size Range: 3–50+ Tons",
    body: "Gardner Air services commercial RTUs from small 3-ton rooftop units on a single-tenant retail pad to 50-ton-plus large-tonnage units on warehouse and big-box retail facilities. Equipment scope, refrigerant circuit configuration, and service access all vary across this range. A technician familiar with one size class is not automatically prepared for another — Gardner Air staffs technicians with experience across the full commercial RTU spectrum.",

No items are deferred because the scheduled time ran out.",
  },
  {
    title: "Repair and Troubleshooting",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/repair/",
    body: "When an RTU is underperforming or offline, Gardner Air's technicians diagnose the root cause rather than working through a parts list. Covers refrigerant leak detection and recovery, compressor evaluation, economizer fault analysis, ignition and heat exchanger inspection, blower motor and belt diagnostics, and controls fault isolation.",
  },
  {
    title: "Replacement",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/replacement/",
    body: "When an RTU reaches the end of its service life or a major component failure makes replacement the right financial decision, Gardner Air manages the replacement process from equipment specification through startup — including refrigerant recovery, curb adapter selection, equipment rigging, controls integration, and startup documentation.",
  },
  {
    title: "Installation and Startup",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/installation/",
    body: "New RTU installation and startup requires proper curb installation, refrigerant charging, controls commissioning, ductwork connection verification, and a documented performance baseline. Gardner Air follows the manufacturer's startup procedures and delivers a startup report before the equipment is accepted.",
  },
];

const COMMON_ISSUES = [
  {
    title: "Compressor failure",
    body: "Compressor failures on RTUs are almost always preceded by detectable warning signs: elevated discharge temperature, abnormal amperage draw, refrigerant charge deviation, or oil contamination. Gardner Air identifies these conditions during maintenance visits, not after the compressor locks out on a hot afternoon.",
  },
  {
    title: "Economizer and damper failure",
    body: "A stuck-open economizer damper in summer pulls hot outdoor air into the supply stream and forces the refrigerant circuit to work against itself. A stuck-closed damper eliminates the free-cooling benefit and can cause indoor air quality issues. Gardner Air verifies damper travel, actuator function, and economizer controls logic on every maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Refrigerant loss",
    body: "Refrigerant loss on a packaged unit does not always present as obvious underperformance — it often shows up first as elevated suction superheat, longer run cycles, or elevated discharge pressure. Gardner Air performs a complete leak survey and refrigerant charge verification rather than adding refrigerant without identifying the source of loss.",
  },
  {
    title: "Blower motor and belt issues",
    body: "Supply fan belt wear, sheave misalignment, and motor bearing degradation reduce airflow and increase motor amperage. Left unaddressed, they lead to motor failures and downstream duct pressure issues. Gardner Air checks belt tension, sheave condition, and motor amperage as part of every standard maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Ignition and burner issues",
    body: "Igniter failure, cracked heat exchangers, and partially blocked burner ports create either a no-heat condition or, more seriously, combustion gases entering the supply airstream. Gardner Air inspects the full gas-fired heating section — burner condition, heat exchanger integrity, gas valve operation, and flue — on each maintenance visit.",
  },
  {
    title: "Curb and gasket leaks",
    body: "Rooftop unit curbs seal the unit to the roof membrane and ductwork below. Deteriorated curb gaskets allow conditioned air to escape and unconditioned air to enter the supply stream, degrading both efficiency and indoor air quality. Gardner Air inspects curb condition and gasket integrity as part of RTU service.",

                  The Backbone of Commercial Conditioning Deserves a Complete Maintenance Program

                  <p>
                    Commercial packaged rooftop units are the backbone of the built environment in Southern California. A single RTU failing during a retail peak season, warehouse production run, or restaurant service window does not fail quietly — it fails with consequences: heat stress for staff, product loss, customer complaints, and often a rushed repair call to whoever answers the phone first.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gardner Air specializes in the commercial RTU systems that condition office buildings, big-box retail, food service facilities, distribution centers, and light industrial operations throughout Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Orange County. Rooftop units are deceptively complex: they combine a refrigerant circuit, gas-fired or electric heat, supply and exhaust airflow, economizer controls, and in many cases variable air volume staging — all in a single rooftop enclosure exposed to direct sun, wind, and temperature extremes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Qualified RTU maintenance is not a time-block exercise. Gardner Air completes every item on the maintenance scope during every visit, and delivers a written report documenting what was found and what was done. Facilities managers across Southern California retain Gardner Air not to respond to RTU failures, but to prevent them.
