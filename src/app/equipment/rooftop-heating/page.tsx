const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "How often should commercial rooftop heating be serviced?",
    a: "Commercial rooftop unit heating sections should receive a complete preventative maintenance inspection at every heating-season startup — at minimum once per year. Facilities with high-occupancy spaces, schools, healthcare facilities, or manufacturing operations where a no-heat event carries significant operational or safety consequences often benefit from a mid-season check as well. The correct interval depends on equipment age, burner configuration, and how critical continuous heating is to the facility's operations.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a heat exchanger inspection and why does it matter?",
    a: "A heat exchanger inspection is a systematic examination of the heat exchanger surfaces — the metal barrier that separates the combustion gases from the supply airstream in a gas-fired heating system. Cracks, holes, or corrosion in the heat exchanger allow combustion byproducts, including carbon monoxide, to enter the supply air and be distributed to occupied spaces. Visual inspection of all accessible surfaces is the baseline; pressure testing or smoke testing is used where visual access is limited or where a visual inspection is inconclusive. Gardner Air performs heat exchanger inspection as a required scope item on every heating-season startup.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does combustion analysis tell you about a rooftop heater?",
    a: "Combustion analysis measures oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide concentrations in the flue gas to calculate combustion efficiency and verify that the burner is operating within its designed air-to-fuel ratio. A burner running with insufficient air produces CO and soot; a burner running with excess air wastes fuel and reduces heat output. Combustion analysis gives a technician the data needed to adjust the burner to its optimal operating point and to document that performance as a baseline for future visits. Gardner Air performs combustion analysis on every rooftop heating startup visit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the most common causes of a no-heat call on a commercial RTU?",
    a: "The most common causes of a heating failure on a commercial rooftop unit are ignition module failure, flame sensor lockout from oxide fouling, gas valve malfunction, inducer motor failure, and blown limits from restricted airflow or a dirty filter. Most of these conditions develop gradually and are detectable during a scheduled maintenance visit before they cause a full failure. Facilities whose rooftop units are on Gardner Air's maintenance program experience significantly fewer no-heat events because these components are tested operationally — not just visually inspected — at every heating-season startup.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you service makeup air heaters and unit heaters?",
    a: "Gardner Air services gas-fired makeup air heaters from Modine, Reznor, and Cambridge Engineering, as well as unit heaters serving warehouses, loading docks, and industrial spaces. Makeup air heaters require the same combustion analysis and heat exchanger inspection as packaged rooftop units, with the additional consideration of airflow verification given their high-volume outdoor air handling function. Unit heaters require ignition system testing, heat exchanger inspection, and combustion verification on every annual startup.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Southern California's climate affect rooftop heating equipment?",
    a: "Southern California's mild climate means commercial heating equipment sits idle for a significant portion of the year — often 6 to 8 months in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. That extended idle period accelerates certain failure modes: ignition modules degrade through thermal cycling and ambient humidity; flame sensors develop heavier oxide fouling; gas valve seals can stiffen from lack of use. Equipment that ran reliably through the previous heating season needs to be operationally verified before it is called on again — the conditions that cause a first-fire failure in January were often present in March.",

const HEATING_TYPES = [
  {
    title: "Gas/Electric Rooftop Units (Heating Section)",
    body: "Packaged gas/electric rooftop units are the dominant heating and cooling platform in commercial construction across Southern California. The heating section — gas valve, ignition system, heat exchanger, inducer, and flue — requires a complete inspection and startup at every heating season. Gardner Air's service scope covers the full heating section: combustion analysis, heat exchanger inspection, ignition system function, gas valve operation, inducer motor condition, and flue termination inspection.",
  },
  {
    title: "Modulating Gas Burners",
    body: "Modulating gas burners adjust firing rate in proportion to the heating load, operating across a range from minimum to full capacity rather than cycling on and off at full fire. They deliver more consistent space temperatures and better fuel efficiency than single-stage equipment, but require accurate combustion tuning across the full modulation range. Gardner Air performs combustion analysis at multiple firing rates on modulating equipment to verify performance across the operating envelope.",
  },
  {
    title: "Two-Stage Gas Heating",
    body: "Two-stage gas heating systems operate at a reduced first-stage capacity for most heating loads and advance to full capacity when conditions require it. Compared to single-stage equipment, two-stage systems reduce short-cycling, deliver more even temperature distribution, and extend component life. Service requirements include verification of stage sequencing, combustion performance at both stages, and controls calibration.",
  },
  {
    title: "High-Efficiency Condensing Rooftop Heat",
    body: "High-efficiency condensing gas heating sections achieve thermal efficiencies above 90% by extracting latent heat from flue gases and managing condensate. They are found in newer commercial construction and high-performance renovation projects. Service requirements include condensate drain management, secondary heat exchanger inspection for corrosion, and combustion analysis to verify operation in condensing mode.",
  },
  {
    title: "Makeup Air Heaters",
    body: "Makeup air heaters condition large volumes of outdoor air for commercial kitchens, manufacturing facilities, laboratories, and other spaces with high exhaust rates that require tempered supply air. Gardner Air's service scope for makeup air units covers combustion analysis, heat exchanger inspection, airflow verification, and controls integration with the building's exhaust and ventilation systems. Brands serviced include Modine, Reznor, and Cambridge Engineering.",
  },

  },
  {
    title: "Repair and Troubleshooting",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/repair/",
    body: "When a rooftop unit's heating section fails to ignite, short-cycles, produces inadequate heat output, or trips a safety limit, Gardner Air diagnoses the root cause.

Existing maintenance clients receive priority scheduling.",
  },
  {
    title: "Replacement",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/replacement/",
    body: "When a rooftop heating section reaches end of service life, or when a cracked heat exchanger makes full unit replacement the correct safety and financial decision, Gardner Air manages the replacement process from specification through startup — including gas line coordination, controls integration, combustion commissioning, and full startup documentation.",
  },
  {
    title: "Installation and Startup",
    href: "/commercial-hvac-services/installation/",
    body: "New rooftop unit installation and startup on the heating side requires combustion commissioning, gas pressure verification, heat exchanger clearance inspection, controls sequencing verification, and a documented performance baseline before Gardner Air considers the system accepted. Factory startup procedures are followed for each manufacturer's equipment.",
  },
];

const COMMON_ISSUES = [
  {
    title: "Ignition module failures",
    body: "Ignition modules degrade through thermal cycling over the off-season. An ignition module that passed its last spring inspection may fail to produce a reliable spark at first-fire in the fall. Gardner Air tests ignition module function — spark timing, electrode gap, and module output — on every heating-season startup rather than waiting for a reported failure.",
  },
  {
    title: "Cracked heat exchangers",
    body: "A cracked heat exchanger is a safety-critical condition. Combustion gases, including CO, can enter the supply airstream through a crack and be distributed to occupied spaces. Heat exchanger inspection — visual examination of all accessible surfaces, with pressure or smoke testing where warranted — is a required scope item on every Gardner Air heating startup.",
  },
  {
    title: "Gas valve issues",
    body: "Gas valves can fail open, fail closed, or develop internal leakage that causes irregular firing. Gas valve evaluation — pressure drop across the valve, leak-down testing, and operational response — is part of Gardner Air's heating maintenance scope. A gas valve that does not open and close cleanly is replaced before it causes a no-heat condition or a gas event.",
  },
  {
    title: "Flame sensor fouling",
    body: "Flame sensors develop a thin oxide coating over the off-season that increases electrical resistance and reduces the sensor's ability to verify flame presence. This causes nuisance lockouts on first fire or intermittent shutdown during the heating cycle. Gardner Air cleans and verifies flame sensor function on every heating-season startup.",
  },
  {
    title: "Inducer motor failures",
    body: "The inducer motor creates the draft necessary for safe combustion and venting. A motor drawing high current, running hot, or operating with excessive bearing noise is approaching failure. Gardner Air measures inducer motor current, checks for bearing noise, and evaluates draft pressure on every visit — the inducer is one of the most common causes of mid-season heating failures on older rooftop units.",
  },
  {
    title: "Burner tuning and combustion drift",
    body: "Burner air-to-fuel ratios shift as components wear, gas supply pressure varies seasonally, and altitude and temperature conditions change. A burner operating with incorrect combustion wastes fuel, produces excess CO, or both. Gardner Air performs flue gas analysis on every heating-season startup to verify and correct combustion performance.",

  },
  {
    title: "Factory-trained technicians.",

                  The Heating Section Is the Safety-Critical Component

                  <p>
                    The heating side of a commercial rooftop unit is the most safety-critical component in the system. A cracked heat exchanger does not just reduce heating efficiency — it creates a pathway for combustion gases, including carbon monoxide, to enter the supply airstream. In a rooftop unit serving an occupied office, school, or retail space, that condition is a life-safety issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gardner Air services the gas-fired heating components of commercial rooftop units and standalone heating equipment across Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Orange County. That includes the heating sections of packaged gas/electric rooftop units, modulating and staged gas burners, makeup air heaters, and unit heaters serving warehouses, loading docks, and industrial spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Southern California&rsquo;s mild climate means commercial heating equipment sits idle for a longer portion of the year than in colder climates. That extended idle period increases the likelihood of ignition module degradation, flame sensor fouling, inducer motor issues, and first-fire ignition failures at startup. Equipment that runs reliably through November needs to be verified before it is called on in January.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Facilities managers across Southern California retain Gardner Air not for emergencies, but to prevent them.
